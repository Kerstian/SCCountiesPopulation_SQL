# SCCountiesPopulation_SQL

In this project, I used data provided by the United States Census Bureau to analyze the population for the population of the counties throughout South Carolina from 2020 until 2023. I created a database in PostgreSQL and answered the following questions:

    1. What was the total population of South Carolina in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023?
    2. What was the average population per county in South Carolina in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023?
    3. Which 3 counties experienced the most growth over the 4 years?
    4. Which 3 counties experience the least growth over the 4 years?
    5. What are the top 5 most populous counties in South Carolina?
    6. What is the total population by region?

1. What was the total population of South Carolina in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023? Using the SUM() function I was able to determine the total population in SC for 2020, 2021, 2022, & 2023 </br>
-Population in 2020 = 5,132,151 </br>
-Population in 2021 = 5,193,848 </br>
-Population in 2022 = 5,282,955 </br>

-Average county population in 2021 = 112,910 </br>
-Average county population in 2022 = 114,847 </br>
